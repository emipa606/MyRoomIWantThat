Pawns do stuff to their own rooms from available minified things.


Right now on rare tick pawn will look for a minified thing they find beautiful to make their room impressive up to their threshold. 
ie normal folks like an Impressive Room and will install art you got lying around to get there. 
and Greedy people will always. 
and Astetics will never.

pawns will rarely rearrange their rooms as well.
